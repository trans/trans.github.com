            <h1>The YADSL Rule</h1>

<p>Looks like the Ruby world is a fire with new DSLs for BDD/TDD. There&#39;s

... woulda, coulda ... My word! So many choices. It&#39;s fitting that
it&#39;s Thanksgiving, what we have here is a <i>cornucopia of framework</i>!!!</p>

<p>Uh... Okay, you&#39;ll have to forgive me. I get carried away.</p>

<p>I suppose it all started with that RSpec. Those guys built an incredibly 
elaborate nomenclature to help us spell out our code&#39;s behaviors in gruesome
detail. But as wonderfully grandiose as it may be, there&#39;s just one tiny little
itty-bitty problem... <i>I can&#39;t remember it</i>. Oh, sure, I could sit down and
jam it into my already overloaded brain somewhere, but you know what. I ain&#39;t
gonna. I already have enough new stuff to learn and I&#39;m not going to bother to
learn another DSL when those I already know work just as well.</p>

<p>So therein lies the serious downside to any new DSL. They require more brain
cells. We&#39;re talking the old &quot;learning yet another language&quot; dilemma here. I was
thinking about this today, and it strikes me as one of those cool rules we oft
hear about. So I decided to &#39;writ&#39; one for the occasion.</p>

<blockquote>
  "Don't create a DSL if a native solution would be just as elegant."
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, a good DSL will likely need to be substantially more elegant in order
to fully justify its existence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling this the <i>YADSL Rule</i>, for &quot;Yet Another Domain Specific Language&quot;.</p>

<p>Now, a quick look around the world of modern programming 
(see <a href="http://dzone.com">DZone</a>),
just as quickly makes clear that the YADSL rule is in no short supply of
violations. Indeed, I dare say, that most of programming today is not innovative,
but masquerading around as such via YADSL.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t want to seem too harsh. There is of course a certain level of
refinement taking place in some areas. And that naturally has to play itself
out. But it&#39;s getting a little crazy. Besides test frameworks, web frameworks 
and Javscript development frameworks seem to have hit a New Cambrian Explosion.
I don&#39;t see how we&#39;re supposed to keep up with it.
I can only hope that my little rule might help to cool all
this exuberance down a bit; so we can catch our breaths and take some time
to consider the torrential downpour of verbiage that has befallen us.</p>

<p>Of course, the real problem may be that too many people want to make YANFT
(Yet Another Name For Themselves).</p>

<p>I swear to you. I&#39;m not one of them. But I will be introducing my own Ruby
test framework soon.</p>

<p>No. I&#39;m not kidding.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, there&#39;s no new DSL to learn. And that&#39;s what makes my framework
so very special. I&#39;ll keep you posted.</p>
