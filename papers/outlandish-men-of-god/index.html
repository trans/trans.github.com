<h1>Outlandish Men of God</h1>

<p>The claim that "God said" is inheriently outlandish.</p>

<p>Men have natural tendecies to discredit others according to their own emotional dispositions. Emotions are either comfortable or uncomfortable and degreed.</p>

<p>Men then write, "I say, you should not " but fail to contniue, "because it makes me feel uncomfortable".
But adding this simple qualification weakens the charge. So men emblish. And the most egrigous embelisher take a rather egregious step.
The change it to "God said" and write it down in an attempt to claim it forever. Of course others read these things, and if their affinities
match the dogma, then the "God said" gains another battle cry.</p>

<p>Anyone can identify the source of such commands though basic inquiry. Seek a rational for the adage and you will soon seen the explination
weaving its way around a central dogma, not sound in reason, but squarely tethered to inherient feelings.</p>

<p>Feelings bridge the gap between the physical sensation of the world and the actions within it. Unlike thoughts, feelings compel us. They can be difficult
to overcome and sometimes practiaclly impossible.</p>

<p>The most sensual of feelings and the most simplistic is tactile pain and pleasure. This is really the key to understanding emotions:
pain and pleasure are emotins. The sensation of pinching, burning or smooting, or whatever the particular sensation may be, is in itself purely sensory.</p>

<p>Emotions act as a primative form of thought. They compel us to action.</p>

<p>Is Free Will an Emotion?</p>
