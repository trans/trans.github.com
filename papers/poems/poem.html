I could dance words off the rays of stars
that spoke of your beauty, that lives in mine
comic avengers on a vision quest to rip the rafters off the divine
to open hearts and thrust in melodies of witching love potions

and if you should hear these words
beware the untranquil unsettling of a love that will put yours to shame
