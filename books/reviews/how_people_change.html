<h1>How People Change</h1>

<h2>by Allen Wheelis</h2>

<p>This a short auto-biographiucal book about the will to change
from the perspective of a psychologists. In particular the
author himself struggles with the contradiction between the 
deterministic circumstances that shape our being, and our
ability to change ourselves via free-will. Utimately the
author argues that both are vaild views of reality.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by the hardship his dying father put upon
him as his way to ensure his sons properity --at least
from his perspective. He forced his son to mow a field with
hand shears for an entire summer, all day, every day. When
he had finally finsihed, his father told him,</p>

  <blockquote>
  "At any rate, we learned how to work, and there's nothing
  more important for a boy to learn. It's something you
  haven't learned yet, son."

  "You will, though, If you ever amount to anything
  you'll learn. You're learning now. I wish you could
  understand, though, that I wouldn't be trying to
  teach you so fast if I knew I would live long enough
  to teach you more slowly."

  "Remember son, whenever it seems like I'm being hard
  you...it's because I love you. (pg. 67-68)
  </blockquote>

<p>The author feels otherwise however, because he also sees these
events as what led to his neurosis. I concur with this, but I
do think the author judges his father too harshly for it.
The man was dying, and did what he felt best for his son,
right or wrong.</p>

<p>His father died not long there after.</p>

<p>The author emphizes the importance of examining one's significant
failures in life, in order to effecitvely change.</p>

<p>One exceptional passage in the later analysis, the sequence
of change:</p>

  <blockquote>
  "suffering, insight, will, action, change" (pg. 102)
  </blockquote>

<p>I think that is a good sequence to remember.</p>
