<h1>Neuromancer</h2>

<h2>by William Gibson</h2>

<p>Okay, I know this is, like, the rave of post-modern techo-fiction.</p>

<p>But really the writting is just a crumby --a scam even. It's not 
very good, rather it's just full of so much unintelligable
"future-speak" that it *seems cool*.</p>

<p>The overall dipiction of the future is a corpristist society
largely controlled by a few elitest families, or perhaps it is
just the one family which this book focuses upon, who keeps their
dominance via AIs (atrifical intelligences). This family has grown
increasing  incestuious over the years --disfunctional, psychotic
and detached from reality (one character kills for pleasure). An
AI of theirs decideds to put an end to them and gain it's own
freedom. But due to certian built-in limitations of it's programming,
must setup elaborate means via other persons --in particular the
hacker hero of the story, Case, and his bad-ass body-guard heroine
Molly.</p>

<p>Thankfully the book's ending is much more engaging, and made it
worth trudging through the first half.</p>

<p>You might get a kick out of the rasifarian space ferriers.</p>
