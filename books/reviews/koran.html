<h1>Koran</h1>

<p>First of all the Koran is an increadably boring book to read straight through.
It's is quite likely the most repetitive book ever printed. With the exception
a few brief stories, usually very rough retellings of Torah and Gospel stories,
one could read any 20 consectutive pages and get a solid notion of Islam.
But in a sense, this is advantagous for the religion. It is almost elegantly simple.
With a handful of primary precepts and a few dozen or so minor rules, it is not
a religion hard to adhear. In fact the Koran specifically makes this very claim.
The book itself is quite aware that it is repetitive.</p>

<p>The basic moral "physics" of Islam, is quite simple: Believe in Allah, the one
true god, and do good works, and you will be rewarded, most noteably with eternal
happiness in the Garden of Eden. If you do not, however, believe in Allah and fall
pray to evil, then you will suffer eternal suffering engulfed by fire.</p>
