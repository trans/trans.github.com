      <p><b>I believe the Ruby community may have finally gone off the rails in it's collective
crazy train.</b> I have been readying about <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>,
the spiffy new RubyGems manager to be default part of Rails 3.0, and I can't help but
wonder what track we were even on.</p>

<p>If you don't know about Bundler yet, you can learn about it
<a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/03/using-the-new-gem-bundler-today/">here</a>.
I imagine most of you are already aware of it and are now considering how it fits in
with your future development plans. So I want so ask a more fundamental question:
Why does Bundler even exist?</p>

<p>On the surface, we can of course thank Rails. The deployment of web applications
stands apart from the distribution of Ruby packages. Deploying a Rails
application usually means copying an app's files up to a server, as opposed to
creating a distributable package file (like a gem) and installing that on
the remote machine. Technically the later could be done, but it isn't, probably
because most web apps are proprietary and do not need wider distribution. Because
Rails developers do not use the normal RubyGems distribution mechanism, which
automatically installs dependencies, they need another way to ensure their apps
dependencies are present, hence the convenience of <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>No doubt, this was not the driving cause for the existance of Bundler. It probably
wasn't even much more than a passing thought in the minds of Bundler's developers,
but nonetheless I beleive it is the <i>first need</i> that has more or less gotten
the ball rolling, for it and many related projects
(e.g. <a href="http://www.capify.org/index.php/Capistrano">Capistrano</a>).</p>

<p>The driving cause, on the other hand, is probably Bundler's name-sake --it's ability
to download the gems an application is dependent upon and store them directly
within the project itself. These gems get stored in a project's
<code>vendor/gems/</code> directory. The rationalized benefit being that you
need never worry about remote services going down (e.g. <code>rubygems.org</code>)
in order to deploy your application, nor ever worry about any potential changes in
a dependent gem. So in brief, one can <em>bundle</em> dependent gems with ones application.</p>

<p>At first blush it seem like great idea. After all developers use vendoring to
do something similar while developing an application. But lets consider this
a bit more carefully. The worry of a remote service going down is, honestly, bordering
on paranoia. That's why mirrors of RubyGems.org exist. If one goes down, the others
remain. The odds of all mirrors going down at the same time are extremely small, and
as you might imagine, such a situation would be corrected very quickly, if it ever did
occur. In fact, if it did happen, there is a fair chance your host will be down too.
So the solution here is not bundling, but redundancy. As for the
fear of "monkey releases", i.e. new versions of a gem that that might break an app,
this is somewhat understandable, but redistributing every dependency with each app
is shear overkill. If you are that concerned a gem will break an application you can
always specify exact requirements in the gemspec, and use the <code>gem</code> method to nail the
version down. That, in fact, is the whole point of the <code>gem</code> method. And it is a
perfectly good solution for applications such as a Rails app. Unfortunately is is not
a very good solution for general purpose libraries. (As can be read about in any number
of blog posts by searching
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Don%27t+require+%27rubygems%27">Don't require 'rubygems'</a>.)</p>

<p>I should mention that the latest version of Bundler (v0.9) has a light-weight rendition
of bundling, called <em>locking</em>, which doesn't actually store the gem in the application,
but automatically locks the gems your application uses to specific versions. In other
words, it generates a file which will call the <code>gem</code> method to nail down the exact
versions of gems your application is using at that time. As mentioned
above, this is a much better approach than bloating your application with .gem files,
and to Bundler's credit it makes it easy to keep those <code>gem</code> calls current.
However, it still ties your program to RubyGems, so again it's not a perfect solution
for reusable libraries.</p>

<p>Another feature Bundler sets out of handle are <em>groups</em>. They are "gem environments"
which can be loaded as a collective, or even omitted during an install. In other words,
they are a way to specify a specific group of gems to the <code>bundle</code> command or in ones
code with <code>Bundler.require</code>. The most common groups you are likely to see are <code>runtime</code>
or <code>production</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>development</code>, patterned after Rails own database
environments. While I will not dismiss out-of-hand the potential of deriving some
utility from this feature, on the whole I suspect it is a YAGNI. Moreover,
it exposes the developer to even more potential deployment errors. I can only
imagine the failures that will arise because a testing environment
had a gem that the runtime environment forgot to add, but actually needed.</p>

<p>In addition, the use of Bundler promotes the use of <code>Bundler.require</code>. How many
countless hours have been spent reminding people not to put <code>require 'rubygems'</code>
in their lib code? Now the issue will be doubly compounded. While we can hope
that Bundler never makes it's way beyond Rails, I have already seen it in at
least two non-Rails programs.</p>

<p>Lastly, Bundler also provides an ability to depend on git repos, so long as
they track a .gemspec. This feature is a clear address to vendoring, but
via gem dependencies. I won't even go into all the issues that arise with this
(and seems to somewhat contradict Bundler's primary purpose --or at least compound it's need!).
You can read some of the back and forth on this idea <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/02/using-gemspecs-as-intended/">here</a>. I will say, however, what really strikes me most about this is
how an unproven system takes on such fanfare that it's proponents now declare we have
all been doing it wrong! A <code>.gemspec</code> should never be generated by some "extraneous
build tool", but ought to be edited by hand and checked into the scm repository. Wow.</p>

<p>I realized the Bundler is addressing certain needs, primarily of the Rails community.
The problem with Bundler is that it is trying to correct something that is fundamentally
problematic from the start. On two fronts... The first being that RubyGems ties
a packaging system to versioning, so using the <code>gem</code> command will never be a universally
applicable solution to lock down versions. And the second, more significant issue, that RubyGems,
and hence Bundler, cannot resolve <b>version conflicts</b>. RubyGems blows-up when it
encounters a conflict. Bundler only mitigates this issue by giving you a heads up before you
ever run a test. This is the real heart of the matter, and it stems from the fundamental
lack of version support in Ruby itself. Until that is addressed, all of these fancy solutions
are simply trains headed up the wrong track.</p>

      <a class="article-title" href="/20100413-module-inheritence/index.html">A Case for Module Inheritance</a>
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>I love beautifully written code. Unfortunately the realities of the
language sometimes clash with requirements of the implementation. While
Ruby goes a long way toward making beautifully written code common place.
It still has some shortcomings I'd like to see improved.</p>

<p>Case in point are my endeavors of the last few days. I've been struggling
to re-structure the code of the <a href="http://github.com/rubyworks/english/">English</a>
project. The primary purpose of the project is to provide extension methods to String,
pertaining to the English language. A good example are number inflection
methods #singular and #plural. At the same time I am trying to design
the library in such a way that other language modules can be built following
the same basic structure, and they could all work together if need be.</p>

<p>In the course of this endeavor I decided the best approach, keeping the future
squarely in mind, is to create a Language module, upon which English depends,
to house all the common logic of (most) languages. For example, the logic for
storing plural and singular special cases might be a good candidate since nearly
every language has to account for these. So the relationship between English
and Language is clearly one of "inheritance" --I want to encapsulate logic at
a general level of abstraction, upon which more specific cases can inherit and
augment to fit their particular requirements.</p>

<p>In Ruby this kind of relationship is generally handled by class inheritance.
But here I run into an issue. <code>English</code> and <code>Language</code>
are modules, and they are modules because they are <i>singleton</i>. Now even
though we can include a module into another, which is akin to class inheritance,
it does not work quite like class inheritance. For one thing, metaclass methods
are not inherited via <code>include</code>. Of course, I could tip-toe around
this issue by using <code>extend</code>, since in this case I do not need
includable instance methods. But there is a much more subtle issues that
raises it's head: the dreaded Double Inclusion Problem. That's a serious
headache in my case because I want my end users to have the option to load
only the components they want to use as needed, rather than forcing them to
load the entire system up-front.</p>

<p>So, despite the many
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=singleton+pattern+evil">calls for the death
of the Singleton Pattern</a>, it looks like I might require it for my implementation
of English. Using modules simply comes with too many headaches and hackish work arounds.
Now I agree with all the Singleton nay-sayers. It is sort of an anti-pattern to
create a class that will only ever have one instantiation and no state, but
the trade-off here is worse. If only...</p>

<p>It seems to me the truly fantastic solution to this would be if one module
could inherit from another just as we do with classes. And honestly, is there
really any reason we shouldn't be able to do this?</p>

<p>What is nice about this, something I know that Matz will appreciate, is that
it preserves single-inheritance, in contrast to the alternative of
turning <code>include</code> into a multiple-inheritance mechanism. And
for the love of code beauty, it would mean at least a reduction in use of the
all too common:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>.<span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">included</span>(base)
    base.extend <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">ClassMethods</span>

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">module</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">ClassMethods</span>
    <span style="color:#888"># ...</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Not only is it ugly, it is even worse for those trying to inherit and
extend the behavior. Something more elegant is clearly desirable, and
Module Inheritance, as I have demonstrated here, might be just the ticket.</p>

<p>You can see from the #generate_tests method I was able to ensure that the results
were indeed equivalent (an interesting strategy in dynamic testing, perhaps
worth further exploration for production code).</p>

<p>After the <code>CodeIdentity</code> class all was required was to apply a little
<i>Brain Power</i> to come up some identities. I came up with a pretty simplistic lot,
just as proof of concept. By following the original email thread, no doubt we can see
their a assuredly an infinite number of possibilities that could be defined.</p>

      <h1>Ruby's Operator Precedence Can Be Improved</h1>

<p>There's a lot to love about Ruby. Most of us know well the many great advantages it provides, as they
say, "making programming fun". However, Ruby is also notoriously dogged by a few small gotchas and inconsistancies.
Some of these are understandable, such as the <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki/The+double+inclusion+problem">Double Inclusion Problem</a>;
issues that are not worth the extensive effort to fix. On the other hand, some simple issues doggedly persist for little good
reason (backward compatibility not withstanding).</p>

<p>One of these issues is operator precedence. Not only is operator precedence set in stone, it is also
woefully <i>bottom heavy</i> --there is only one binary operator available for use above the common arthmetic operations.</p>

<p>Here is the table as given by the <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/ruby/ProgrammingRuby/language.html">PickAxe</a>:</p>

<pre><code>Method    Operator                Description
Y         [ ] [ ]=                Element reference, element set
Y         **                      Exponentiation
Y         ! ~ + -                 Not, complement, unary plus and minus (method names for the last two are +@ and -@)
Y         * / %                   Multiply, divide, and modulo
Y         + -                     Plus and minus
Y         &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;                   Right and left shift
Y         &amp;                       Bitwise `and'
Y         ^ |                     Bitwise exclusive `or' and regular `or'
Y         &lt;= &lt; &gt; &gt;=               Comparison operators
Y         &lt;=&gt; == === != =~ !~     Equality and pattern match operators (!= and !~ may not be defined as methods)
          &amp;&amp;                      Logical `and'
          ||                      Logical `or'
          .. ...                  Range (inclusive and exclusive)
            ? :                     Ternary if-then-else
          = %= { /= -= += |= &amp;=   Assignment
          &gt;&gt;= &lt;&lt;= *= &amp;&amp;= ||= **=   
          defined?                Check if symbol defined
          not                     Logical negation
          or and                  Logical composition
          if unless while until   Expression modifiers
          begin/end               Block expression
</code></pre>

<p>The lack of any operators other then <tt>**</tt>, above the most commonly used, <tt>* / % + -</tt>, puts
a frustrating limitation on the flexibility of this system. On this account, the most puzzling misplacement of an operator
has to be Bitwise Exlusive Or, <tt>^</tt>. In many, if not most, programming languages <tt>^</tt> is the power operator.
But in Ruby that function is delegated to <tt>**</tt>. While I personally do not favor <tt>**</tt> for the use,
it's not something I mind either. However, that <tt>^</tt> doesn't share the same precedence is very awkward.</p>

<p>Consider for instance, the implementation of a unit system.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
    <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>.meters ** <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>  =&gt; <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">4 square meters</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Notice the power operator effects the unit and the value. So how would we go about notating <code>2 square meters</code>?
We need some other means. The obvious answer is to redefine <tt>^</tt>:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
    <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>.meters ^ <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>  =&gt; <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">2 square meters</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Great. But wait, there is an ugliness now upon us.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
    <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>.meters ^ <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span> / <span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">2</span>  =&gt; <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">2 meters</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>The answer should have been <tt>1 square meter</tt>, but due to precedence <tt>2 / 2</tt> is barring a <tt>1</tt> before
the <tt>^</tt> power operator kicks-in.</p>

<p>It is truly wonderful that Ruby's first 27 operators are actually methods, which means they can be defined to perform whatever
function we would like of them. But despite being able to define these operators, there is no means of changing their
precedence. Thus, the actual options we have defining new operations to suite our needs are hindered.</p>

<p>Ideally we would be able to alter precedence on a per-class basis. While, some might argue that would create too much confusion,
I would retort that good libraries would use the feature effectively, limiting the changes to the appropriate use-cases, so that
it would not be an issue. After all, a library that scrambles precedence for no damn good reason will get little use.</p>

<p>While we wait the day of true precedence freedom, I would like to see Ruby move <tt>^</tt> up with <tt>**</tt> and find a new
Exclusive Or operator. Backward compatibility can be largely, although not completely, preserved by aliasing <tt>^</tt>
to the new symbol. It's an obvious and simple improvement --a naggling issue that has been around for quite some time.</p>

      <h1>Another Static Website/Blogging Tool</h1>

<p>If you were wondering, you are reading the old TigerOps.org blog. I have discontinued that
Wordpress-based blog due to spam overload, and have replaced it with this new site. Rather
than use Wordpress, this site is now running on <a href="http://proutils.github.com/brite">Brite</a>,
a home grown static website and weblog construction tool.</p>

<p>Now I know there are plenty of these out there, in particluar you have the <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>
backed <a href="http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and the very nicely designed
<a href="http://www.matthias-georgi.de/shinmun">Shinmun</a>, not to mention some of the senior tools
like <a href="http://webby.rubyforge.org/">Webby</a> and <a href="http://rote.rubyforge.org/">Rote</a>.
So, why do we need yet another? The reasoning is essentially two-fold.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am a knit pick. With each alternitive I found a few nagging points upon which I
wanted to see a different approach taken.</p></li>
<li><p>I wanted to see if I could push the boundries, absorbing what good I may from
earlier systems (including my own stalled attempts) and contruct something
more intuitve and yet more powerful.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>With inline formats I think Brite has achieved that. You can easily have multiple types
of markups in a single page, in an elegant and relatively unobtrusive manner. (Yea, Wow!)</p>

<p>For example the document I am currently writing is in Markdown format. But...</p>

<p>This is using textile, and&#8230;</p>
<p>
This is using RDoc&#8217;s Simple Markup format.
</p>


<p>And this is raw HTML.</p>


<p>Furthermore, formats are plugable. We already have <a href="http://coderay.rubyforge.org">Coderay</a>
syntax highlighter support and are looking to add MathML support soon too. So this feature
allows for some truly amazing quick and easy contruction of web documents.</p>

<p>Another innovation of Webrite is the non-separation of markup files from their
generated output. This means one does not have to worry about dealing with source
subdirectory and site desitnations and the copying static files. All the files stay right
where they are frist created. The markup files use special extensions (.post, .page, .layout)
to differentiate then from the .html results. One simply filters the list of files when
publishing.</p>

<p>Webrite is still in the very early stages of development. It still needs features such as
pagination and tagclouds. But it is coming along rapidly, and I look forward to what is
coming downt he road. Future innovations may include <em>aquisition</em> (a la Zope and UserLand Frontier),
as well as a realtime Rack-based server.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p><a href="http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">WxRuby</a> is probably the best overall GUI library for Ruby currently available. It is cross-platform, provides native look-and-feel and is stable enough for production use. All other GUI libraries, despite their various merits, fall short in at least one of the areas. However, WxRuby does have one major downfall. It is pretty much a straight port of the C API. Writing WxRuby code is largely the same as writing actual WxWidgets C code. It's far from the "Ruby Way".</p>

<p>So how did I mange to get fairly nice Ruby code despite a binding that is essentially a straight port of the underlying C API? I built it from the bottom-up using a lazy coding technique. And I mean "bottom-up" literally --the following code might actually be easier to read if you start from the bottom and work your way up to the top. The trick is to break down one's interface into individual widgets and create an instance method for each using the <code>||=</code> memoization trick.</p>

<p>You can see from the following code I was able to apply this "trick" to everything but toolbar buttons (aka 'tools'). This is because the toolbar itself is needed to create them. So I simply defined attributes for each tool, but actually created the tool buttons in the toolbar's method. Have a look.</p>


<!-- [gist id="182301"] -->
<script src="http://gist.github.com/182301.js"></script>


<p>The thing to notice, if you haven't caught it yet, is how calling <code>#search_toolbar</code> leads to calling <code>#search_sizer</code> which in turn leads to calling <code>#search_panel</code>, and so forth all the way to the top <code>#frame_panel</code>. This code is a striped down version of actual code I am using. I hope it helps others create wxRuby application more easily. As I said in my previous post, I found in mind-numbingly difficult to create WxRuby interfaces until I worked out this approach. WxRuby is still a difficult API to master, but this technique makes the effort more manageable, and therefore more likely to succeed.</p>

<p>For another example of building structures lazily, have a look at <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/122593">my solution</a> for <a href="http://rubyquiz.com/quiz10.html">Ruby Quiz 10 - Crosswords</a>.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>Recently I had to buckle down and create and honest to goodness desktop GUI application in Ruby. So once again, after some six years, I set down to weigh my options. It saddens me to say, after all these years, the state of desktop GUI programming with Ruby is still a rather sorry affair. Yes, there have been many improvements --thanks to the hard work of many a good programmer, but the task of creating a Ruby-based GUI application still remains a very non-Ruby-esque ordeal.</p>

<p>My first attempt at it this time was with <a href="http://shoooes.net/">Shoes</a>. Shoes is a new and very nice GUI engine written largely from scratch by the well known WhyTheLuckyStiff. It's a noble effort and some really <a href="http://the-shoebox.org/">neat programs</a> can come from using Shoes. Unfortunately for my needs Shoes proved to be too buggy and immature --at times I saw visual artifacts and there are a very limited number of controls. And worst of all, the fact that it includes it's own Ruby interpretor and manges it's own gems caused it not to work well with some other libraries. For instance, I could not get it to use the latest version of Mechanize.</p>

<p>After examining other choices, such as creating one GUI script per major platform (too much work), or using the old standby FxRuby (never been happy with the lack of native look-and-feel), I decided to try a different course. I was well versed in web application design, so I tried my hand at rigging a web app to act like a desktop app via a locally running server using Ajax calls. The end result certainly looked good and basically worked. But there was a troubling lack of robustness in the interaction between the front-end and back-end. I had to poll the back-end to see what was going on, and the back-end had to spawn threads in order to provide a response to the browser while continuing to work on long-running processes. So it worked, but barely. I'm sure it could be improved, but for a devote POLSer like myself, that meant getting into mucky waters I really didn't feel like I should need to be diving into anyway. Too bad. Web GUI design is quite advanced compared to Desktop GUI. Why no one has tried to map it directly to the desktop before is beyond me (but you can believe me when I tell you, I can't wait to delve into Plam's pre and it's <a href="http://developer.palm.com/webos_book/book1.html">webOS</a> development platform, which apparently does exactly this).</p>

<p>So where did this leave me? Well, I figured I had one last good shot with <a href="http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">wxRuby</a>. Ironically I had something to do with the birth of that project. It was those six years ago that I first looked into GUI frameworks for Ruby. Rich Kilmer was talking about his Utopia/Alpha ideas and I was just starting to feel comfortable with writing scripts in Ruby. I decided there needed to be something better, and working off of Rich's idea's for an API I came up the idea of GUtopIa, which would supply a font-end API that anyone could interface to a back-end GUI framework. Sort of a best of all worlds kind of design. A number of people were psyched about the idea, and joined with me to discuss and pursue the project. Unfortunately, I was still wet behind the ears, and the fellow programmers who first entertained working with me didn't care much for my new-boy-brash style. They told me so, and decided on their own course, to create bindings for wxWidgets instead. I wasn't happy about it personally. Having studied wxWidgets some, I knew it would be a long time before anything really useful was to come of that project --if at all. In hindsight, while I still believe GUtopIa is a good idea, I am glad it's didn't proceed back then --I still had a lot to learn about Ruby before I could do something like that as well as I would really like.</p>

<p>So it was time to check out what the wxRuby team had accomplished. My first handful, or so, attempts were miserable failures. WxRuby has some issues. It is tempermental, and so much like the C API I felt like I was actually programming in C. This is not how Ruby programming is supposed to be! I was having real trouble getting anything more then a basic frame and menu to work. Frustrated with the straight coding approach, I decided to see what WYSIWYG form builders were to be had. I knew wxWidgets touted these, so I looked around and found the precisely named wxFormBuilder. This made it fairly easy to design my complex form and best of all it made it clearer to me how wxWidget GUIs are built. Unfortunately the generated markup, called an XRC file, had issues of it's own and wouldn't load properly into Ruby. Once again, I was at a dead end.</p>

<p>Something really needed to be done about this state of affairs. And so I have decided to resurrect the GUtopIa project. I found my old code, looked at it, scrapped it, and started fresh. I'm going to proceed by specifying the front-end API as much as possible, before even considering back-end implementations. With any luck others will see what I'm doing and offer to build a an interface to their favorite framework. So far what I have looks very sweet. Just to wet your whistle, here's a potential example.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  layout = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">GUtopIa</span>::<span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">Layout</span>.new <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">do</span>
    [ [ <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">Name</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>  ], [ entry ] ]
    [ [ <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">Phone</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span> ], [ entry ] ]
    [ [ <span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">EMail</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span> ], [ entry ] ]
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  layout.show

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Yes, believe it or not, that's a fairly complete GUI layout. In an upcoming post I'll explain how it all works in more detail. But before I get into that, I still need a working desktop GUI application ASAP! I don't have time to develop GUtopIa for this. So now I've tried again at coding wxRuby from hand, but this time using a very Ruby-esque lazy evaluation approach I had experimented with a long time ago in a <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a> on <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz10.html">crossword puzzle drawing</a>. Finally I got the results I wanted with out going cross-eyed looking at the code. Amazing how a well organized approach can make all the difference. I'll demonstrate my design in my next blog post.</p>

      <h1>The Future of Web Design?</h1>

<p>In a <a href="http://tigerops.org/2009/01/mf-vs-xml.html">previous post</a>, I point out that microformats bring an additional layer of useful information to a document, which I dubbed <em>semantic structure</em>. In short, HTML tags provide useful <em>type</em> information about the data they contain. A good example of this has been the insistent push to use <code>div</code>s rather than <code>table</code>s for page layout. The reason is that tables describe a semantic structure, a table of data, and not layout. I for one have found this a frustrating haggle in the design of my pages. Time and time again I have been stymied by unwieldy <code>div</code>s. Tables are much easier to use, despite additional verbosity. But I have stuck to <code>div</code>s because it is "the right thing to do". Thankfully my saving grace will soon be here. The 3rd revision the CSS standard supports a new <code>display</code> style. With it, one can specify that a div is to behave like a table, table row or table cell. Woohoo! Three cheers for tabley divs!!</p>

<p>This display style led me to think about semantic structure again. If we can designate that a <code>div</code> is a <code>table</code> structure via CSS, then why not any structure? And if <code>div</code>s, why not any tag? If we were able to do that, then semantic structure could be specified solely through CSS. And our HTML pages could go from rather simple, repetitive occurrences of <code>div</code> to ... can you guess?... pure XML.</p>

<p>Let's got through it step by step. Here some HTML:</p>

<p>  [gist id=61726]</p>

<p>Now with CSS 3:</p>

<p>  [gist id=61729]</p>

<p>Of course no one would recommend doing this to something that really is a table of data. But bare with me, because now we are coming full circle:</p>

<p>  [gist id=61730]</p>

<p>I think this is a rather remarkable outcome. And you might be surprised to learn that Firefox handles it just fine. What we have achieved is an ultra-clean separation between the data and it's semantic meaning, via XML, and it's semantic structure, via CSS. If this approach were embraced by the XHTML and CSS standards bodies, I would not be surprised to see it revolutionize web design.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>Decisions, decisions. Therein lies the reason why convention over configuration is so bloody great, precisely because it requires fewer decisions. <a href="http://proutils.rubyforge.org/syckle">Syckle</a>, my humble build tool, outputs log files. Yea, logs are good. But the decision I have to make is, "in what format?"</p>

<p>Now old-school would just put out some asterisk-studded text files with plenty of precise timestamps, maybe some nice long <code>------------------------------</code> lines to divide things up. No doubt these files are easy to access and fairly readable. We like out text files. But hey wait. This is the age of magical markups. At the very least we can coax that log into a Wiki-tongue. For us Rubyists, we have rdoc, markdown and textile's just a few gemy fingertips away. These formats can be even easier to read thanks to structural consistency from log to log. Plus, fire-up a web server and we can get some really nice looking HTML too. That's the beauty of Wiki Wiki markup after all.</p>

<p>Now if beauty were all that matter, then there would be no point in looking further. But like America's continental shelves there is untapped wealth going to waste here. There is data in them there logs! The modern buzzword is <em>semantic</em>. Taking logs to the next level requires us to ensure their semantic value. On that account, XML was created, and long predicted the format of the future. Certainly XML has made great strides, but it is still far from meeting its promise. There is simply too much complexity involved in both marking up the content and in generating nice output.</p>

<p>Then comes along the <em>microformat</em>. The microformat combines the semantic capabilities of XML with the layout capabilities of HTML. Microformats are relatively new and still finding their footing. Indeed, I think a <em>Universal Uniform Microformat Specification</em> is ultimately the necessary outcome. In that vain I make a first rough estimate of what such unifying system might look like, and why, contrary to many arguments otherwise, microformats do in fact bring more to the table than XML.</p>

<p>Where XML provides semantic information within a doubly linked hierarchy (via attributes and body), microformats provide the same plus a set of well defined data structures. Microformats provide semantics through a small set of tag attributes, <em>role</em>, <em>rel</em>, <em>rev</em> and primarily the <em>class</em> attribute. The <em>class</em> attribute alone is enough to make microformats fully equatable to XML. We can easily map the same data set in either format:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#070">&lt;people&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:#070">&lt;person&gt;</span>
      <span style="color:#070">&lt;name&gt;</span>John Jay<span style="color:#070">&lt;/name&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:#070">&lt;/person&gt;</span>
  <span style="color:#070">&lt;/people&gt;</span><span style="color:#070">&lt;/pre&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>As opposed to...</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#070">&lt;div</span> <span style="color:#007">class</span>=<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">people</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span><span style="color:#070">&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:#070">&lt;div</span> <span style="color:#007">class</span>=<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">person</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span><span style="color:#070">&gt;</span>
      <span style="color:#070">&lt;span</span> <span style="color:#007">class</span>=<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span><span style="">name</span><span style="color:#710">&quot;</span></span><span style="color:#070">&gt;</span>John Jay<span style="color:#070">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
    <span style="color:#070">&lt;/div&gt;</span>
  <span style="color:#070">&lt;/div&gt;</span><span style="color:#070">&lt;/pre&gt;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Although the microformat is more verbose, the two contian the same original semantic value. But the extra verbosity isn't just a waste of UTF bytecodes, it says something. Specifically it gives us a <em>semantic structure</em>. It just so happens that HTML evolved to offer these structures precisely because that is what data presenters require to do their jobs well. And for the same reason, why you are always being beat with the <code>div</code>-stick when you try to take the load road of laying out your pages with tables.</p>

<p>So what semantic structures do micorformats via HTML make available to us? The quick rundown: we have layouts using <em>div</em> and <em>span</em>, lists using <em>ol</em>, <em>ul</em> and <em>li</em>; definition lists using <em>dl</em>, <em>dd</em> and <em>dt</em>; and tables using <em>table</em>, <em>tr</em>, <em>th</em> and <em>td</em>. Those are the obvious structures. There are still other smaller structure's like <em>a</em> for links, and the hefty set of <em>form</em> elements. All these elements provide us a way to say what type of thing our data is or partakes in, not just what the data is.</p>

<p>Clearly, the creators of XML saw the need for something like this and tried to achieve it through XML Namespaces. But namespaces are less effective because they are completely arbitrary, whereas HTML gives us a limited but universal structural language. Seems to me there is a principle to be found here that can be a guide for both the future of HTML and Microformats.</p>

... woulda, coulda ... My word! So many choices. It's fitting that
it's Thanksgiving, what we have here is a <i>cornicopia of framework</i>!!!</p>

<p>Uh... Okay, you'll have to forgive me. I get carried away.</p>

<p>I suppose it all started with that RSpec. Those guys built an incredibly
elaborate nomenclature to help us spell out our code's behaviors in gruesome
detail. But as wonderfully grandiose as it may be, there's just one tiny little
itty-bitty problem... <i>I can't remember it</i>. Oh, sure, I could sit down and
jam it into my already overloaded brain somewhere, but you know what. I ain't
gonna. I already have enough new stuff to learn and I'm not going to bother to
learn another DSL when those I already know work just as well.</p>

<p>So therein lies the serious downside to any new DSL. They require more brain
cells. We're talking the old "learning yet another language" delemma here. I was
thinking about this today, and it strikes me as one of those cool rules we oft
hear about. So I decided to 'writ' one for the occasion.</p>

<blockquote>
  "Don't create a DSL if a native solution would be just as elegant."
</blockquote>


<p>In fact, a good DSL will likely need to be substantially more elegant in order
to fully justify its existence.</p>

<p>I'm calling this the <i>YADSL Rule</i>, for "Yet Another Domain Specific Language".</p>

<p>Now, a quick look around the world of modern programming
(see <a href="http://dzone.com">DZone</a>),
just as quickly makes clear that the YADSL rule is in no short supply of
violations. Indeed, I dare say, that most of programming today is not innovative,
but masquerading around as such via YADSL.</p>

<p>Now I don't want to seem too harsh. There is of course a certain level of
refinement taking place in some areas. And that naturally has to play itself
out. But it's getting a little crazy. Besides test frameworks, web frameworks
and Javscript development frameworks seem to have hit a New Cambrian Explosion.
I don't see how we're supposed to keep up with it.
I can only hope that my little rule might help to cool all
this exuberance down a bit; so we can catch our breaths and take some time
to consider the drenchal downpour of verbage that has befallen us.</p>

<p>Of course, the real problem may be that too many people want to make YANFT
(Yet Another Name For Themselves).</p>

<p>I sware to you. I'm not one of them. But I will be introducing my own Ruby
test framework soon.</p>

<p>No. I'm not kidding.</p>

<p>Don't worry, there's no new DSL to learn. And that's what makes my framework
so very special. I'll keep you posted.</p>

      <a class="article-title" href="/20081006-old-hash/index.html">This Old Hash</a>
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
      <p>The Hash may well be the most used class in Ruby. Sure, our programs
have arrays and strings galore, but they generally come and go without
much ado. Hashes on the other hand get <em>used</em>; and by that I mean to
say, we spend a lot of time fussing with them. I think there are two
significant reasons for this and I will focus on the first, and
the more important of the two, here.</p>

<p>Now, I suspect you would agree, if I were to present you with a class
which was clearly overkill for vast majority of its intended uses, and
its use required repeated mitigation of its unused features, I have no
doubt, you'd unequivocally advise me to select a "<i>better tool for the job</i>".
And yet, that's the situation all Ruby programmers face, day in and
day out, with Ruby's Hash.</p>

<p>Ruby's Hash is exceptionally powerful because it supports any type of
object as a hash key. That's really really cool... for all of about
five minutes. The truth is, the vast majority of cases only require
one type of key --for Ruby that will either be a Symbol or a String,
and because of this, a great deal of time and code is wasted ensuring
all keys are that single type. Because of this, methods like
<code>#to_sym</code> often riddle our scripts.</p>

<p>The issue is undeniably attested to by real world "solutions"
others have created to address it, such as Ruby Facets'
<a href="http://facets.rubyforge.org/doc/api/core/classes/Hash.html#M000124">Hash#rekey</a>.
and Ruby on Rails'
<a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/HashWithIndifferentAccess.html">HashWithIndifferentAccess</a>.
But let's face it, these are both underwhelming attempts at mitigating
the fundamental problem.</p>

<p>A real solution would have the current Hash class renamed, and a new
limited-key structure put in its place. The old class would still be
available, of course, for those special cases when a key of any object
type is required, but the new, more utilitarian Hash class would be
the literally-constructed default. The end effect of this change would
be simple:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  h[<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">a</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>] == h[<span style="color:#A60">:a</span>]
  h[<span style="background-color:#fff0f0;color:#D20"><span style="color:#710">'</span><span style="">1</span><span style="color:#710">'</span></span>] == h[<span style="color:#00D;font-weight:bold">1</span>]

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This means reducing all hash keys to a single <em>symbolic</em> index type.
It does not matter what the actual reference is, a String, Symbol,
Integer, etc. just so long as it has a predictable symbolic
representation.</p>

<p>It may feel a bit strange to consider a suggestion that actually calls
for the reduction of features. More often change requests call for just
the opposite and YAGNI has to be peddled out on them. But, I think, we
often underestimate the power of simplicity. Consider ideas such as
convention-over-configuration and duck-typing --simplifications that
are not necessarily intuitive at first. But in the end, they make our
life as programmers a good bit more productive.</p>

      <h1>An Ally OOP for If-Conditions</h1>

<p>Ruby takes a unique approach to conditional evaluation: <i>All
objects are equivalent to <code>true</code> except <code>nil</code>
and <code>false</code></i>. No doubt this is a more object-oriented
approach than, say, C's use of <code>0</code> as false, but it's far
from the ideal of OOP all the way down, as any
<a href="http://pozorvlak.livejournal.com/94558.html">Smalltalker</a>
can attest.</p>

<p>Consider the following case. For a while now. I have wanted in my arsonal
of Ruby classes a NullClass defined basically as:</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">class</span> <span style="color:#B06;font-weight:bold">NullClass</span> &lt; <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">NilClass</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">method_missing</span>(*a)
      <span style="color:#038;font-weight:bold">self</span>
    <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

  <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">NULL</span> = <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">NullClass</span>.new

  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">def</span> <span style="color:#06B;font-weight:bold">null</span>
    <span style="color:#036;font-weight:bold">NULL</span>
  <span style="color:#080;font-weight:bold">end</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>This object would greatly benefit fluent interfaces. Instead of returning
<code>nil</code>, such intefaces could return <code>null</code>, and no
error would be thrown when invoking any method against it.</p>

<div class="CodeRay">
  <div class="code"><pre>
  obj = null
  obj.it.does.not.matter  <span style="color:#888">#=&gt; null</span>

</pre></div>
</div>

<p>Unfortunately <code>null</code> is not very viable in Ruby
because <code>null</code> still evaluates as <code>true</code>
when used as the expression of a condition. The fact remains,
Ruby is hardcoded to see only the singleton instances of
<code>NilClass<c/code> and <code>FalseClass</code> as false.</p>

<p>I've requested that <code>NullClass</code> be added to core Ruby in
the past (as of yet to no avail) and though I still would like to
see it included, it may be better still to take an altogether
object-oriented approach to conditions --in the spirit of Smalltalk.
This would allow us to freely create "false" objects, like the
<code>NullClass</code>, ourselves.</p>

<p>The adoption of such a capability does not require the odd syntax
used by Smalltalk (<code>ifTrue</code> / <code>ifFalse</code>).
Rather, it can take an approach more akin to Ruby's own <code>case</code>
statements. As with <code>case</code>'s use of <code>#===</code>,
a particular method would be used to evaluate the "truthiness" of
a value. This would apply for all types of conditions:
<code>while</code>, <code>until</code>, etc.</p>

<p>To clarify, let's say this special method is simply called #if, then...</p>

<p>The result of this condition would be <code>"No"</code>.</p>

<p>While it may not be an earth shattering adjustment, the additional
flexibility opens up some interesting doors. Not only would classes
like the previously mentioned <code>NullClass</code> become possible,
but conditions themselves become <i>dynamically controllable</i>.</p>

<p>For example, it would allow method probes to fully map method
signatures (the Halting Problem not withstanding). This is not
currently possible in Ruby because a probe cannot pretend to evaluate
to false in order to walk through the false side of a condition.</p>

<p>The idea would require some getting used to --after all a simple
if-statement would no longer do what we Rubyists presently take
for granted. But then, that's the nature of progress, is it not?</p>

      <h1>Taskable</h1>

<p>On more than a few occasions I have taken a stab at writing a general
purpose task system, akin to Rake's, but one that works within the
framework of Ruby class inheritance. I recall my first attempt was
quite an unwieldy beast, and my subsequent attempts were fairly
unwieldy too, but over time they became more concise. Below is the
most concise variation yet, and I was wondering what other thought
of it -- do you see any flaws in the design; does it satisfy all the
criteria of such a system; would you find it useful; etc.</p>

<p>One issue to note about the code, is the use of the *_trigger methods.
I'm not sure that's the best approach. My original approach was
to provide a #run method (you can see it commented out), but this
requires dividing Taskable into two parts, a module for extending and
a module for including, and I try to avoid that design when I can.</p>
