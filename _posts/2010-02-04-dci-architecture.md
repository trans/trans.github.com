In what has to be the best
[software development presentation](http://architects.dzone.com/videos/dci-architecture-trygve)
I have seen in years, Trygve Reenskaug, one of the early computer
programming pioneers, takes us for a entertaining exploration of why
programming today is so broken and introduces us to a new "level"
to object oriented design he calls DCI (Data, Collaborations, and Interactions).

For some time, I have been having ideas and intuitions along much the same lines.
I even toyed with "Orthogonal Ruby" in which methods can be developed outside
of the classes they ultimately belong. So I was delighted to watch this, and see
a master like Reenskaug spell it out so clearly and actually provide working
demonstations in SmallTalk (the forbearer of Ruby's Object Model). 

If you are at all interested in <i>The Next Big Thing In Programming</i>,
I highly recommend you check it out. <b>Warning!</b> It's lengthy! But obviously
I wouldn't tell you about it if I didn't think it was well worth the time.
