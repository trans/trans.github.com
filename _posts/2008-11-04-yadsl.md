Looks like the Ruby world is a fire with new DSLs for BDD/TDD. There's 
[RSpec](http://rspec.info/),
[minitest](http://blog.zenspider.com/minitest/),
[Test::Unit 2.x](http://test-unit.rubyforge.org/test-unit/),
[test-spec](http://test-spec.rubyforge.org/test-spec/),
[Assert 2.0](http://www.oreillynet.com/ruby/blog/2008/02/assert2.html),
[Expectations](http://expectations.rubyforge.org/),
[Cucumber](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/tree/master),
[Remarkable](http://github.com/carlosbrando/remarkable/tree/master),
[Shoulda](http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/shoulda/)
... woulda, coulda ... My word! So many choices. It's fitting that
it's Thanksgiving, what we have here is a <i>cornicopia of framework</i>!!!

Uh... Okay, you'll have to forgive me. I get carried away.

I suppose it all started with that RSpec. Those guys built an incredibly 
elaborate nomenclature to help us spell out our code's behaviors in gruesome
detail. But as wonderfully grandiose as it may be, there's just one tiny little
itty-bitty problem... <i>I can't remember it</i>. Oh, sure, I could sit down and
jam it into my already overloaded brain somewhere, but you know what. I ain't
gonna. I already have enough new stuff to learn and I'm not going to bother to
learn another DSL when those I already know work just as well.

So therein lies the serious downside to any new DSL. They require more brain
cells. We're talking the old "learning yet another language" delemma here. I was
thinking about this today, and it strikes me as one of those cool rules we oft
hear about. So I decided to 'writ' one for the occasion.

<blockquote>
  "Don't create a DSL if a native solution would be just as elegant."
</blockquote>

In fact, a good DSL will likely need to be substantially more elegant in order
to fully justify its existence.

I'm calling this the <i>YADSL Rule</i>, for "Yet Another Domain Specific Language".

Now, a quick look around the world of modern programming 
(see [DZone](http://dzone.com)),
just as quickly makes clear that the YADSL rule is in no short supply of
violations. Indeed, I dare say, that most of programming today is not innovative,
but masquerading around as such via YADSL.

Now I don't want to seem too harsh. There is of course a certain level of
refinement taking place in some areas. And that naturally has to play itself
out. But it's getting a little crazy. Besides test frameworks, web frameworks 
and Javscript development frameworks seem to have hit a New Cambrian Explosion.
I don't see how we're supposed to keep up with it.
I can only hope that my little rule might help to cool all
this exuberance down a bit; so we can catch our breaths and take some time
to consider the drenchal downpour of verbage that has befallen us.

Of course, the real problem may be that too many people want to make YANFT
(Yet Another Name For Themselves).

I sware to you. I'm not one of them. But I will be introducing my own Ruby
test framework soon.

No. I'm not kidding.

Don't worry, there's no new DSL to learn. And that's what makes my framework
so very special. I'll keep you posted.
