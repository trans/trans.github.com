            <p><h1>XDG NG</h1>

<p>I can never stress enough the value of using the XDG directory standard to
developers. This is one of those standards that can only really benefit us
all if enough developers truly care to make a better eco-system.</p>

<p>I have decided to take two approaches to my encouragment. The first is to
improve the current XDG API to the point of triviality. It will be one script,
which others can copy to their project if they prefer it to having another
dependency. And I will make it even easier to use --one point of entry,
and readily obvious semantics.</p>

<p>But more I have decided to go beyond this and crrate a new standard --a derivation to
the XDG standard that takes an well demonstrated Rails practice into account: convention
over configuration. By doing so the standard can be further simplified and thus 
become even more trivial, and hopfully in this manner become widely supported to 
the benefit of us all.</p>

            <p><h1>A Second Look at Bundler</h1>

<p>A few days ago I wrote an article on my concerns with Bundler. Since then I&#39;ve received enough feedback to refine my thoughts. My opinion that the Ruby/Rails community is on a &quot;crazy train&quot; with regards to Bundler has everything to do with state of complexity of Rails code these days and it&#39;s infiltration into plain vanilla Ruby projects. Of course, Bundler&#39;s intent is to do just the opposite, but such is the danger of new technologies that we must be cautious of inevitable unexpected consequences. So, taking the feedback into account, here&#39;s a better breakdown of the ups and downs of Bundler as I now see them.</p>

<h2>On the Upside</h2>

<p><b>Bundling</b>: I have been informed that the ability to bundle gems is a useful feature for administrators of systems with limited Internet access. I did not expect this to be common enough to even warrant a tool (just use a tarball). But apparently is common enough. For this use Bundler is understandably useful. It&#39;s ability to resolve dependencies pre-runtime makes it especially good at doing so.</p>

<p><b>Installs</b>: The <code>bundle install</code> feature has similar applications to bundle. It can be used to ease deployment. More specifically, a deployment script can contain a simple invoke &#39;bundle install&#39;, rather then handle the installation of each gem itself. In addition it makes it easier for developers to get up and running quickly, a simple &#39;bundle install&#39; will install everything you need to develop a project. So this feature has it&#39;s clear benefits.</p>

<p><b>Groups:</b> Groups are convenient when selecting certain gems from the list of all requirement, as a means to specialize usage to the end-users needs. Although perhaps a minor benefit, one can see how it can be useful to the developer. As currently implemented Bundler only supports opt-out groups. It might be nice if it also provided for opt-in selections.</p>

<p><b>Locking</b>: The locking feature is probably Bundler&#39;s most significant feature. It allows the developer to nail down their application to the latest gems that best meet all the requirements as given in the Gemfile. </p>

<p><b>Gemfile</b>: Of course, Rubyists are accustomed to nice DSL to &quot;describe&quot; code. The Gemfile makes excellent use of this ability and it is especially nice to have a single clear file to describe all the dependencies of a project.</p>

<h2>On the Downside</h2>

<p><b>Bundling</b>: The downside of bundling comes when developers misuse the feature. Because Bundler does more than just bundle gems for special deployments, there may be a tendency towards using it in this way regardless of the need to do so. For example, yesterday I cloned the <a href="http::/github.com/qrush/gemcutter">Gemcutter</a> repository. The download consumed 22.61 MiB of space. On close inspection I discovered why. The <code>vendor/cache</code> directory contains a copy of every gem on which Gemcutter depends. Consider what this means. In effect, Bundler has undermined the entire purpose of having a package manger!</p>

<p>If Bundler were an application that handled this feature and only this feature, then I think it would be a much better tool. In doing so it would help deter misuse. And the other features could be left to the domain of another library, or even better, RubyGems proper.</p>

<p><b>Installs</b>: The downside of <code>bundle install</code>, is the lack of refinement it grants the end user. An example is the Rails Gemfile which will installs the sqlite3, postgresql and mysql bindings, regardless of what databases the system actually supports. There may also be other subtle conditions that need to be taken into account on installation. To account for these, the temptation will be to add conditions to the Gemfile itself, blurring the lines between it and a Capfile (as an example). But this will in turn effect the developer&#39;s use of the other features. In the end, the inter-complexities this will cause will simply prove too much.</p>

<p><b>Groups</b>: You&#39;ll be happy to know there is nothing intrinsically problematic with groups. Other than the additional complexities they add to the process of designing a Gemfile and the installation thereof, they server their purpose. Sometimes additional complexity is the necessity of capability.</p>

<p><b>Locking</b>: Ironically, Bundler&#39;s most useful feature is probably it&#39;s most problematic. First, in order to achieve this level of functionality, Bundler must download a slew of gems to your system in order to calculate the best fitting requirements. But worse than this, locking brings <code>Bundler.require</code> into play. <code>Bundler.require</code> admits of the same issues as <code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;</code>. It can not be used without limiting an program to the RubyGems package manager. If it is to be used congenially, special conditions will need to be put in place by the developer to ensure a program still runs whether RubyGems is being used or not. Bundler might mitigate this issue by gracefully downgrading if RubyGems is not loaded, but then it must also consider where Bundler&#39;s lock file will be located, say if setup.rb is used for installation.</p>

<p><b>Gemfile</b>: As mentioned, the Gemfile is great to have as a single configuration file to describe dependencies. However, if a project has a gemspec, it still requires dependencies be stated there as well. RubyGems is not able to utilize the Gemfile. Having to state requirements twice violates the DRY principle.</p>

<p>In addition, because the Gemfile is Ruby code it can be full of conditional statements, dynamic code, and all sorts of other spaghetti. All of which make the file unusable to anything but a Ruby script. Worse still, the ability to use conditions has the potential for creating a very unwieldy level of complexity. There is no way, for instance, to query the Gemfile for all requirements that may be need because some of them may be hidden by the current state of an environment variable. The clear remedy to this is to switch to a static file format. Such a format could be utilized by many tools, not just Bundler, including RubyGems itself. This would also help resolve some the issues with bundle install as mentioned above.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>Taking the &quot;good, the bad and ugly&quot; into account as we have, the end result would indicate the following potenial points of action:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a static file format for the Gemfile.</li>
<li>Allow groups to be opt-in as well as opt-out.</li>
<li>Split Bundler into two projects. One strictly for bundling.</li>
<li>Non-bundling features might be integrated into RubyGems proper.</li>
<li>At the very least allow RubyGems to utilize the Gemfile for gem building.</li>
<li>Gracefully downgrade when RubyGems/Bundler is not used.</li>
</ul>

<p>By applying these points, we can tame some of the &quot;crazy train&quot; of complexity. The principles of POLS and KISS are halmarks of a good Rubyist. Let&#39;s not loose that.</p>

            <p><h1>Gem Crazy</h1>

<p><b>I believe the Ruby community may have finally gone off the rails in it&#39;s collective
crazy train.</b> I have been reading about <a href="http://gembundler.com/">Bundler</a>,
the spiffy new RubyGems manager to be default part of Rails 3.0, and I can&#39;t help but
wonder what track we were even on.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know about Bundler yet, you can learn about it
<a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2009/11/03/using-the-new-gem-bundler-today/">here</a>.
I imagine most of you are already aware of it and are now considering how it fits in
with your future development plans. So I want so ask a more fundamental question:
Why does Bundler even exist?</p>

<p>On the surface, we can of course thank Rails. The deployment of web applications
stands apart from the distribution of Ruby packages. Deploying a Rails
application usually means copying an app&#39;s files up to a server, as opposed to
creating a distributable package file (like a gem) and installing that on
the remote machine. Technically the later could be done, but it isn&#39;t, probably
because most web apps are proprietary and do not need wider distribution. Because
Rails developers do not use the normal RubyGems distribution mechanism, which
automatically installs dependencies, they need another way to ensure their apps
dependencies are present, hence the convenience of <code>bundle install</code>.</p>

<p>Bundler achieves this goal in a grand fashion. As its name implies
it does so by giving us the means to download the gems an application is dependent
upon and store them directly within the project itself. These gems get stored in
a project&#39;s <code>vendor/gems/</code> directory. The rationalized benefit being 
that you need never worry about remote services going down (e.g. <code>rubygems.org</code>)
in order to deploy your application, nor ever worry about any potential changes
in a dependent gem. So in brief, one can <em>bundle</em> dependent gems with ones
application.</p>

<p>At first blush it seem like great idea. After all developers use vendoring to 
do something similar while developing an application. But lets consider this
a bit more carefully. The worry of a remote service going down is, honestly, bordering
on paranoia. That&#39;s why mirrors of RubyGems.org exist. If one goes down, the others
remain. The odds of all mirrors going down at the same time are extremely small, and
as you might imagine, such a situation would be corrected very quickly, if it ever did
occur. In fact, if it did happen, there is a fair chance your host will be down too.
So the solution here is not bundling, but redundancy. As for the fear
of &quot;monkey releases&quot; --new versions of a gem that that might break things,
this is somewhat understandable, but redistributing every dependency with each app
is shear overkill. If you are that concerned a gem will break an application you can
always specify exact requirements in the gemspec, and use the <code>gem</code> method to nail the
version down. That, in fact, is the whole point of the <code>gem</code> method. And it is a
perfectly good solution for applications such as a Rails app. Unfortunately is not
a very good solution for general purpose libraries. (As can be read about in any number
of blog posts by searching
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Don%27t+require+%27rubygems%27">Don&#39;t require &#39;rubygems&#39;</a>.)</p>

<p>[Update: I have been informed that the real benefit of bundling is to make
it easier to install an application on machines that has limited Internet access.
In such cases, I can see that Bundler might be handly.]</p>

<p>I should mention that the latest version of Bundler (v0.9) has a light-weight rendition
of bundling, called <em>locking</em>, which doesn&#39;t actually store the gem in the application,
but automatically locks the gems your application uses to specific versions. In other
words, it generates a file which (I assume) will ulitmately be used with the <code>gem</code> method
to nail down the exact versions of gems your application is using at that time of the lock.
This is a much better approach than bloating your application with .gem files, to achieve
the same end, and to Bundler&#39;s credit it makes it easy to keep those <code>gem</code> calls current.
However, it still ties your program to RubyGems, so again it&#39;s not a perfect solution
for reusable libraries.</p>

<p>Another feature Bundler sets out to handle are <em>groups</em>. They are &quot;gem environments&quot;
which can be loaded as a collective, or even omitted during an install. In other words,
they are a way to specify a specific group of gems to the <code>bundle</code> command or in ones
code with <code>Bundler.require</code>. The most common groups you are likely to see are <code>runtime</code>
or <code>production</code>, <code>test</code> and <code>development</code>, patterned after Rails own database
environments. While I will not dismiss out-of-hand the potential of deriving some
utility from this feature, on the whole I suspect it is a YAGNI. Moreover,
it exposes the developer to even more potential deployment errors. I can only 
imagine the failures that will arise because a testing environment
had a gem that the runtime environment forgot to add, but actually needed.</p>

<p>In addition, the use of Bundler promotes the use of <code>Bundler.require</code>. How many
countless hours have been spent reminding people not to put <code>require &#39;rubygems&#39;</code>
in their lib code? Now the issue will be doubly compounded. While we can hope
that Bundler never makes it&#39;s way beyond Rails (or at least end-user apps), I have
already seen it in at least two non-Rails programs.</p>

<p>Lastly, Bundler also provides an ability to depend on git repos, so long as
they track a .gemspec. This feature is a clear address to vendoring, but
via gem dependencies. I won&#39;t even go into all the issues that arise with this
(and seems to somewhat contradict Bundler&#39;s primary purpose --or at least compound its need!).
You can read some of the back and forth on this idea <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/04/02/using-gemspecs-as-intended/">here</a>.
I will say, however, what really strikes me most about this is
how an unproven system takes on such fanfare that it&#39;s proponents now declare we have
all been doing it wrong! A <code>.gemspec</code> should never be generated by some &quot;extraneous
build tool&quot;, but ought to be edited by hand and checked into the scm repository. Wow.</p>

<p>I realized the Bundler is addressing certain needs, primarily of the Rails community.
The problem with Bundler is that it is trying to correct something that is fundamentally
problematic from the start. On two fronts... The first being that RubyGems ties
a packaging system to versioning, so using the <code>gem</code> command will never be a universally
applicable solution to lock down versions. And the second, more significant issue, that RubyGems,
and hence Bundler, cannot avoid <b>version conflicts</b>. RubyGems blows-up when it
encounters a conflict. Bundler only mitigates this issue by selectin suiable version before
runtime. But niether allow different versions to run simultatneously. This is the real heart
of the matter, and it stems from the fundamental lack of version support in Ruby itself.
In my opinion, until that is addressed, all of these fancy solutions are simply trains headed
up the wrong track.</p>

            <p><h1>Directory-based Configuration</h1>

<p>With regards to <a href="http://proutils.github.com/pom">POM</a>, 
the most cumbersome issue I have had to struggle with over the course
of its long and somewhat painful development, is the question of
configuration storage. You see, many years ago I hit upon the idea of
using the file system itself as a &quot;hash&quot; for heirarchical storage.
In other words, instead of using a YAML or JSON or an INI file, POM could
use the file system itself.</p>

<p>For example, lets say we have a config file <code>pom.yaml</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="yaml language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">---</span>
    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">name</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">POM</span>
    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">summary</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Project Object Model for Ruby</span>
    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">authors</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
      <span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">Trans</span>
    <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">sites</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span>
      <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">homepage</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">http://proutils.github.com/pom</span>
      <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">development</span><span class="p-Indicator">:</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">http://github.com/proutils/pom</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using the a directory-based configuration system instead
we would have this file hierachy:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">pom/
  name
  summary
  authors
  sites/
    homepage
    development
</code></pre></div>
<p>And each file would contain the data in plain text given in the YAML example above.</p>

<p><i>Does this seam crazy to you?</i>. I think, to most developers, this design will simply strike them as some form of mild insanity. However, I also think reason is mostly form a lack of familiarity, not the ideas relative merits. We are not accustomed to utilizing the file system in this fashion, so it is not surprising the initial reactions would be negative. But lets consider the benefits.</p>

<p>To it&#39;s advantage, a directory-based configuration does not need a support library to read, parse or write any data. Indeed, any coder can put together a viable system to handle directory-based configs in just a few lines of code. Becuase of this, any language, including shell scripts, can utilize the information. There is no concern that my language of choice won&#39;t be able to handle it. It also means that the computer can work with the data very easily, without disrupting the human readability of the same data. Whereas, a YAML file for instance, might become an ugly mess after a program rewrites the file in order to update a single entry. Along the same lines, it becomes very easy to scaffold entries. Copy some files and your good. Old files not specifically copied over remain intact. This &quot;low-bar&quot; of utilily gives directory-based configuration a huge advantage.</p>

<p>But if it is so great, why is it not common place already? Good question. The material cause is that file systems are piss-poor at efficiently storing small files. Even if the file contains a single byte of data most file systems will waste 4K to store it. Becuase of this <i>page size</i> issue the thought of storing many small files <i>on purpose</i> has never been taken seriously. This is changing however. It will be a few more years before the lastest systems are mainstream, but the next generation of file systems (which began I beleive with RieserFS 4) mitigate this problem to the point of irrelevance.</p>

<p>The other major disadvantage it the lack of tools. Because directory-based configuration is not widespread, there are no tools for making it easier to work with data layed out in this fashion. For instance, it is often convenient to edit a group of config options all at once. The best one can with he a directory structure is open a bunch of files simulataneously in a text editor (<code>gedit *</code>) --not an optimal solution. Another example are conversion tools, say converting the data to JSON for transimition via HTTP. To mitigate this we need to create tools that understand the idea of directory-based configuration and give us comfortable interfaces for working with the data within them.</p>

<p>So there are the relative merits, both good and bad, of directory-based configuration storage. If anyone has any others to add I would very muich to hear them. Going on this analysis, I think it is clear that the advantages out weigh the disadvantages since all the disadvantages are becoming or can be mitigated.</p>

<p>However, despite this, I have am seriously considering a move back to a file-based configuration. Why? Becuase directory-based configuration, while arguably better, is simply not common. In 5 to 10 years perhaps it will become more so, but until then it might simply be an design too far ahead of it&#39;s time to gain traction with any mainstrean developers. Clearly it is more important that a tool be found useful to a wide audiance, than it utilize a nifty feature, no matter how nifty it might be.</p>

            <p><h1>A Case for Module Inheritance</h1>

<p>I love beautifully written code. Unfortunately the realities of the
language sometimes clash with requirements of the implementation. While
Ruby goes a long way toward making beautifully written code common place.
It still has some shortcomings I&#39;d like to see improved.</p>

<p>Case in point are my endeavors of the last few days. I&#39;ve been struggling
to re-structure the code of the <a href="http://github.com/rubyworks/english/">English</a>
project. The primary purpose of the project is to provide extension methods to String,
pertaining to the English language. A good example are number inflection
methods #singular and #plural. At the same time I am trying to design
the library in such a way that other language modules can be built following
the same basic structure, and they could all work together if need be.</p>

<p>In the course of this endeavor I decided the best approach, keeping the future
squarely in mind, is to create a Language module, upon which English depends,
to house all the common logic of (most) languages. For example, the logic for
storing plural and singular special cases might be a good candidate since nearly
every language has to account for these. So the relationship between English 
and Language is clearly one of &quot;inheritance&quot; --I want to encapsulate logic at
a general level of abstraction, upon which more specific cases can inherit and
augment to fit their particular requirements.</p>

<p>In Ruby this kind of relationship is generally handled by class inheritance.
But here I run into an issue. <code>English</code> and <code>Language</code>
are modules, and they are modules because they are <i>singleton</i>. Now even
though we can include a module into another, which is akin to class inheritance,
it does not work quite like class inheritance. For one thing, metaclass methods
are not inherited via <code>include</code>. Of course, I could tip-toe around
this issue by using <code>extend</code>, since in this case I do not need
includable instance methods. But there is a much more subtle issues that
raises it&#39;s head: the dreaded Double Inclusion Problem. That&#39;s a serious
headache in my case because I want my end users to have the option to load
only the components they want to use as needed, rather than forcing them to
load the entire system up-front.</p>

<p>So, despite the many
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=singleton+pattern+evil">calls for the death
of the Singleton Pattern</a>, it looks like I might require it for my implementation
of English. Using modules simply comes with too many headaches and hackish work arounds.
Now I agree with all the Singleton nay-sayers. It is sort of an anti-pattern to 
create a class that will only ever have one instantiation and no state, but
the trade-off here is worse. If only...</p>

<p>It seems to me the truly fantastic solution to this would be if one module
could inherit from another just as we do with classes. And honestly, is there
really any reason we shouldn&#39;t be able to do this?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">module Language

  def self.words(string)
    # generic definition
  end

end

module English &lt; Language

  def self.words(string)
    # override
  end

end
</code></pre></div>
<p>What is nice about this, something I know that Matz will appreciate, is that
it preserves single-inheritance, in contrast to the alternative of
turning <code>include</code> into a multiple-inheritance mechanism. And
for the love of code beauty, it would mean at least a reduction in use of the
all too common: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">def self.included(base)
  base.extend ClassMethods
end

module ClassMethods
  # ...
end
</code></pre></div>
<p>Not only is it ugly, it is even worse for those trying to inherit and
extend the behavior. Something more elegant is clearly desirable, and
Module Inheritance, as I have demonstrated here, might be just the ticket.</p>

            <p><h1>GUtopIa Revisited</h1>

<p>Recently I had to buckle down and create and honest to goodness desktop GUI application in Ruby. So once again, after some six years, I set down to weigh my options. It saddens me to say, after all these years, the state of desktop GUI programming with Ruby is still a rather sorry affair. Yes, there have been many improvements --thanks to the hard work of many a good programmer, but the task of creating a Ruby-based GUI application still remains a very non-Ruby-esque ordeal.</p>

<p>My first attempt at it this time was with <a href="http://shoooes.net/">Shoes</a>. Shoes is a new and very nice GUI engine written largely from scratch by the well known WhyTheLuckyStiff. It&#39;s a noble effort and some really <a href="http://the-shoebox.org/">neat programs</a> can come from using Shoes. Unfortunately for my needs Shoes proved to be too buggy and immature --at times I saw visual artifacts and there are a very limited number of controls. And worst of all, the fact that it includes it&#39;s own Ruby interpretor and manges it&#39;s own gems caused it not to work well with some other libraries. For instance, I could not get it to use the latest version of Mechanize.</p>

<p>After examining other choices, such as creating one GUI script per major platform (too much work), or using the old standby FxRuby (never been happy with the lack of native look-and-feel), I decided to try a different course. I was well versed in web application design, so I tried my hand at rigging a web app to act like a desktop app via a locally running server using Ajax calls. The end result certainly looked good and basically worked. But there was a troubling lack of robustness in the interaction between the front-end and back-end. I had to poll the back-end to see what was going on, and the back-end had to spawn threads in order to provide a response to the browser while continuing to work on long-running processes. So it worked, but barely. I&#39;m sure it could be improved, but for a devote POLSer like myself, that meant getting into mucky waters I really didn&#39;t feel like I should need to be diving into anyway. Too bad. Web GUI design is quite advanced compared to Desktop GUI. Why no one has tried to map it directly to the desktop before is beyond me (but you can believe me when I tell you, I can&#39;t wait to delve into Plam&#39;s pre and it&#39;s <a href="http://developer.palm.com/webos_book/book1.html">webOS</a> development platform, which apparently does exactly this).</p>

<p>So where did this leave me? Well, I figured I had one last good shot with <a href="http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl">wxRuby</a>. Ironically I had something to do with the birth of that project. It was those six years ago that I first looked into GUI frameworks for Ruby. Rich Kilmer was talking about his Utopia/Alpha ideas and I was just starting to feel comfortable with writing scripts in Ruby. I decided there needed to be something better, and working off of Rich&#39;s idea&#39;s for an API I came up the idea of GUtopIa, which would supply a font-end API that anyone could interface to a back-end GUI framework. Sort of a best of all worlds kind of design. A number of people were psyched about the idea, and joined with me to discuss and pursue the project. Unfortunately, I was still wet behind the ears, and the fellow programmers who first entertained working with me didn&#39;t care much for my new-boy-brash style. They told me so, and decided on their own course, to create bindings for wxWidgets instead. I wasn&#39;t happy about it personally. Having studied wxWidgets some, I knew it would be a long time before anything really useful was to come of that project --if at all. In hindsight, while I still believe GUtopIa is a good idea, I am glad it&#39;s didn&#39;t proceed back then --I still had a lot to learn about Ruby before I could do something like that as well as I would really like.</p>

<p>So it was time to check out what the wxRuby team had accomplished. My first handful, or so, attempts were miserable failures. WxRuby has some issues. It is tempermental, and so much like the C API I felt like I was actually programming in C. This is not how Ruby programming is supposed to be! I was having real trouble getting anything more then a basic frame and menu to work. Frustrated with the straight coding approach, I decided to see what WYSIWYG form builders were to be had. I knew wxWidgets touted these, so I looked around and found the precisely named wxFormBuilder. This made it fairly easy to design my complex form and best of all it made it clearer to me how wxWidget GUIs are built. Unfortunately the generated markup, called an XRC file, had issues of it&#39;s own and wouldn&#39;t load properly into Ruby. Once again, I was at a dead end.</p>

<p>Something really needed to be done about this state of affairs. And so I have decided to resurrect the GUtopIa project. I found my old code, looked at it, scrapped it, and started fresh. I&#39;m going to proceed by specifying the front-end API as much as possible, before even considering back-end implementations. With any luck others will see what I&#39;m doing and offer to build a an interface to their favorite framework. So far what I have looks very sweet. Just to wet your whistle, here&#39;s a potential example.</p>

<p>Yes, believe it or not, that&#39;s a fairly complete GUI layout. In an upcoming post I&#39;ll explain how it all works in more detail. But before I get into that, I still need a working desktop GUI application ASAP! I don&#39;t have time to develop GUtopIa for this. So now I&#39;ve tried again at coding wxRuby from hand, but this time using a very Ruby-esque lazy evaluation approach I had experimented with a long time ago in a <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/">Ruby Quiz</a> on <a href="http://www.rubyquiz.com/quiz10.html">crossword puzzle drawing</a>. Finally I got the results I wanted with out going cross-eyed looking at the code. Amazing how a well organized approach can make all the difference. I&#39;ll demonstrate my design in my next blog post.</p>

            <p><h1>A Little Fun with Code Generation</h1>

<p>A couple of years ago, a 
<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/vframe.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/293058?292931-293646+split-mode-vertical">Ruby Quiz</a>
asked us <i>to print &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to standard output using Ruby in atypical fashion.</i>
Being the resolute over-achiever-to-a-fault that I am, I decided to take the proverbial
pie-in-the-sky highroad to metaland. If, I thought, I could define code <i>identities</i>,
akin to the mathematical kind, I should be able to have the computer simply
generate an endless stream of equivalent solutions. Indeed, it turned out that it wasn&#39;t
all that hard to code.</p>

<p>You can see from the #generate_tests method I was able to ensure that the results
were indeed equivalent (an interesting strategy in dynamic testing, perhaps
worth further exploration for production code).</p>

<p>After the <code>CodeIdentity</code> class all was required was to apply a little
<i>Brain Power</i> to come up some identities. I came up with a pretty simplistic lot,
just as proof of concept. By following the original email thread, no doubt we can see
their a assuredly an infinite number of possibilities that could be defined.</p>

individual solutions. But I manged to come up with an infinite set of them! ;) </p>

            <h2 class="title"><a href="/2010/02/14/mocking-mocks/" rel="prefetch">Mocking Mocks</a></h2>
            <p><h1>Mocking Mocks</h1>

<p>There are a variety of test-double/mocking libraries available for Ruby.
<a href="http://mocha.rubyforge.org/">Mocha</a> is probably the most well known.
<a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> comes with it&#39;s own mock library. I beleive
<a href="http://flexmock.rubyforge.org/">FlexMock</a> is the venerable older gentleman
on the block. And there are plenty of alternatives such as
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/double-ruby">rr</a> and <a href="http://github.com/jm/stump">stump</a>.</p>

<p>I myself have been toying with an implementation, with a goal of maximizing ease
of use and implemetation overhead. In my pursuit I discovered something very
interesting: Ruby doesn&#39;t necessairly need a test-double library.</p>

<p>Consider the case of a pure <em>stub</em>. Ruby&#39;s Struct class makes pure stubs 
ridiculously easy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">stub</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Struct</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:to_s</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">stub</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span> <span class="c1">#=&gt; &quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And because Struct.new returns a class, they can be reused, adjusted and 
inherited, like any other Ruby class --pretty sweet.</p>

<p>How about the case of a <em>partial stubs</em>. Since Ruby supports singleton methods,
it is a simple matter of latching a new or overriding method onto an object.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">to_s</span>
      <span class="s2">&quot;mocking &quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="k">super</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I mean, how easy can it get? </p>

<p>Ok. So stubs are easy, but how about <em>mocks</em>? Well, let&#39;s first consider what I
call <em>light-weight mocks</em>. These are like mocks in that the set-up conditions
on message invocations, but unlike regular mocks they are triggered during
invocation rather than awaiting a special trigger method (eg. <code>#verify</code>). Again,
these are easy in Ruby. (Note: I am using the <a href="http://proutils.github.com/ae">AE</a>
library for my assertions syntax.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span>

    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nc">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">to_s</span>
      <span class="n">result</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">super</span>
      <span class="n">result</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert</span> <span class="o">=~</span> <span class="sr">/^my/</span>
      <span class="n">result</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>I would argue in most cases light-weight mocks are more than sufficient for most
testing needs. Regular mocks have a tendency to become too enmeshed in implementation,
which creates undo maintenance headaches. Nonetheless, bare with me and we 
we see how to do regular mocks in pure Ruby as well.</p>

<p>Before we get to regular mocks we first need to consider the test <em>spy</em>. Check it out.
We will use one simple helper from Ruby Facets, called Functor.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;facets/functor&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you are wondering, the functor is nothing more than a BasicObject that redirects
<code>#missing_method</code> calls to the block you supply it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">rec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>

    <span class="n">spy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Functor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">rec</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">]</span>
      <span class="n">r</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>

    <span class="n">spy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>All we are doing here is intercepting the calls to <code>obj</code> by delegating through <code>spy</code>.
A record of activity is then being stored in the <code>rec</code> array. With it we can
verify, for instance, that <code>#to_s</code> was called.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">msg</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">op</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="ss">:to_s</span> <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="n">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>And that it returned what was expected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">msg</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">last</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<p>Or we can even verify how many times it was called. Lets call it two more times
to be sure.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">spy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>A little verbose, but nothing too terribly strenuous to understand.</p>

<p>Alright. So now lets turn to full-fledge <em>mocks</em>. As you might have
suspected, mocks are a trivial derivation of spies. All we need to do
is collect our verifications together on a per-method bases and run
through them subsequent to invocations in question.</p>

<p>First lets reset our target object and spy.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">obj</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span>

    <span class="n">rec</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[]</span>

    <span class="n">spy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Functor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">obj</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="n">rec</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">]</span>
      <span class="n">r</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We will store out verifications in a Hash.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">verify</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">Hash</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">new</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">h</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">h</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="n">k</span><span class="o">]=[]</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We define our verification procedures.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">verify</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="ss">:to_s</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">lambda</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">recs</span><span class="o">|</span> 
      <span class="n">recs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">first</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">last</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my object&quot;</span>
      <span class="n">recs</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assert</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can execute the code in question.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">spy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_s</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And verify by iterating over and calling each verification procedure.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">    <span class="n">verify</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">vop</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tst</span><span class="o">|</span>
      <span class="n">recs</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">rec</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">op</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">vop</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="n">op</span> <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="n">tst</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">call</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">recs</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Granted that by the time we get to mocks, the code has gotten a little
more complex and certainly not as pretty as a dedicated mock library.
Nonetheless, what is remarkable here is that it takes so little to get
so much out of Ruby. With a few helper methods wrapping some of the
above code segments we would hardly know we weren&#39;t working with
a full-fledged mocking library.</p>

<p>Moreover as I argued above, one rarely needs to go this far to get
perfectly good test-doubles. Light-weight mocks will cover most
contingencies just as well as their full-fledged brethren without
the worry of taking your tests too far into the realm of implementation
detail.</p>

            <p><h1>Those Damn Version Numnbers</h1>

<p>Per the usual for a developer with too many projects on their hands,
I am constantly on the lookout for new tools to make my work easier.
Being the kind of person who likes to &quot;do it themselves&quot;, I often
end-up writing those tools. Recently I endeavored to make my life a bit
easier by automating, at least in part, my project&#39;s version numbers.
I thought, while only a partial help, that if I added a git post-commit
hook that bumped the patch number one, at the very least I could push
out patches without ever having to fuss with adjusting the version
number manually.</p>

<p><a href="http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html">Git hooks</a>,
by the way, are a cinch to setup. Just edit the
<tt>.git/hooks/xxx</tt> script and turn on its user-executable
permission. As difficult as <tt>git</tt> itself can be to use at times,
this was about as easy as it could get --Developer&#39;s Hog Heaven.</p>

<p>Of course, I overlooked the simple fact that changing my project&#39;s
version file would itself need to be committed b/c it is also tracked
by the version control system, which would in turn invoke the hook,
modifying the version and requiring yet another commit, ad infinitum.
This wasn&#39;t going to work. Crap!</p>

<p>Yet, that little snafu really got the old brain juices flowing and
my fingers blogging. I want to make versioning my projects as simple as
Git&#39;s hooks are to create. Ultra-low maintenance and in need of barely
any consideration. Is it possible? I then thought about Ubuntu&#39;s
versioning policy. Now there&#39;s a low maintenance system! Just use the
release date. I like it. But... it doesn&#39;t tell you anything about the
release. Is it a major release? A minor release? Merely a bug fix?
Or a security fix? There&#39;s no way to tell. And consequently there is no
way to effect one&#39;s dependencies to use only a limited set versions per a
&quot;<a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7">rational versioning policy</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. What about these newfangled &quot;.a&quot; for alpha,
&quot;.b&quot; for beta, indicators that <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>
recently introduced? Aren&#39;t they a means communicating some fact about
the release? And yet are they really version numbers? They attempt
to emulate them by being single letters --sure we can enumerate by
letters just as well as numbers, but isn&#39;t that a shoe-horn --squeezing
information into a version &quot;look alike&quot; of sorts? And that being
the case, then hell with it, why not just do the whole version
scheme the same way.</p>

<p>To that end I propose we consider a new way to version, patterned
after date versions, a la Ubuntu, and augmented with informational
letter tags to tell us what kind of release with which we are dealing.
Let&#39;s consider some possible examples.</p>

<p>10.01.04      # major release
   10.01.05-m    # minor interface changes from previous release
   10.01.06-p    # patch release / bug fix to previous release
   10.02.11-s    # security fix to previous version
   10.04.06-a    # alpha release of next major version
   10.09.21-b    # beta release of next major version</p>

<p>That&#39;s a refreshingly simple scheme. All we would have to manually
specify at release time is the type via a single letter, the dating
is easily automated. (Note, I used a dash for no other reason than
it looked good to my eye. A dot could be used, or even nothing at
all. I really don&#39;t care what provides the delimitation myself.)</p>

<p>Granted, this version scheme doesn&#39;t tell us how many major releases or
minor releases or patch releases have been made since the project&#39;s inception.
But we don&#39;t really need to know that (and if we do we can just program our
package managers to run a summation). What we really need to know is simply
if there is a newer version than our current version, that it is a security fix,
or a minor update, or a major update, and so on, depending on our choice of
significance. Indeed I would even suggest that perhaps we add a some additional
types to help clarify further the type of release.</p>

            <p><h1>Trygve Reenskaug&#39;s DCI Architecture</h1>

<p>In what has to be the best
<a href="http://architects.dzone.com/videos/dci-architecture-trygve">software development presentation</a>
I have seen in years, Trygve Reenskaug, one of the early computer
programming pioneers, takes us for a entertaining exploration of why
programming today is so broken and introduces us to a new &quot;level&quot;
to object oriented design he calls DCI (Data, Collaborations, and Interactions).</p>

<p>For some time, I have been having ideas and intuitions along much the same lines.
I even toyed with &quot;Orthogonal Ruby&quot; in which methods can be developed outside
of the classes they ultimately belong. So I was delighted to watch this, and see
a master like Reenskaug spell it out so clearly and actually provide working
demonstations in SmallTalk (the forbearer of Ruby&#39;s Object Model). </p>

<p>If you are at all interested in <i>The Next Big Thing In Programming</i>,
I highly recommend you check it out. <b>Warning!</b> It&#39;s lengthy! But obviously
I wouldn&#39;t tell you about it if I didn&#39;t think it was well worth the time.</p>
