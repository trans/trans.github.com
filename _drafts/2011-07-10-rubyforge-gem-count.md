There are nearly 9,000 projects now registered on rubyforge.org, but count the gems and you will find less than 5,000. Granted that some projects may have released zip or tarball packages rather then gems, but there are also a number of projects that have release multiple gems. So clearly there are around 3,000 projects that have never release a single package. One wonders what happened to these dreams. Why did they die before ever getting out the gate?

There are some projects on Rubyforge with descriptions that strike the imagination, but unfortunately have not bore fruit.


[RRun](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rrun/) from Gavin Sinclair:

<blockquote>RRun organises and runs small Ruby scripts. Instead of cluttering a bin directory with three-liners and forgetting what you've got installed, use RRun to write them in Ruby, keep them indexed with descriptions, and keep them out of the way.</blockquote>

The project was created back in October of 2005. If I recall correctly, that was back when Rake itself was just getting popular. Perhaps Rake's rise put and end to Gavin's work?


[Whizzbot](http://rubyforge.org/projects/whizzbot) by Kingsley Hendrickse:

<blockquote>Whizzbot is a fully featured IRC-bot implemented in Ruby. Whizzbot can be easily configured to work with a wide range of topics and has a plugin architecture allowing limitless expansion.</blockquote>


[RedPimp](http://rubyforge.org/projects/redpimp/) by Barry Dmytro:

<blockquote>A PIM written in ruby. Most everything about life can be stored into 6 categories. Each category introduces special functionality specific to the type of data stored there. Anything from managing bank accounts to keeping an inventory. Web based interface.</blockquote>


[SUITE](http://rubyforge.org/projects/suite/) by Paul Vudmaska:

<blockquote>SUITE is a site building framework that, hopefully, makes the creation and management of web sites as simple and easy as possible - even if you are not a developer or designer. You don't need software to use SUITE - just a modern browser(NS1.6 or IE).</blockquote>


[myCash](http://rubyforge.org/projects/mycash/) by Rafal Kotusiewicz:

<blockquote>myCash is Ruby and FXRuby desktop application for track family finances. It's very easy to use and in my opinion very useful.</blockquote>

It wasn't hard to find these projects, and obviously we could go on, apparently some 3,000 more times. I would like to encourage anyone with such a project to either take the time to release what they have, or put a final cap in it and ask the Rubyforge guys to delete the project. Keeping a clean and up-to-date software ecosystem is good for Ruby and her community.

Perhaps the Rubyforge team can enhance then system with a flag to mark such projects. Or maybe a rating system could fulfill the role, whereby Rubyforge users could rate projects....
