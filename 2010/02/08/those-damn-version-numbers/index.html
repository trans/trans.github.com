            <h1>Those Damn Version Numnbers</h1>

<p>Per the usual for a developer with too many projects on their hands,
I am constantly on the lookout for new tools to make my work easier.
Being the kind of person who likes to &quot;do it themselves&quot;, I often
end-up writing those tools. Recently I endeavored to make my life a bit
easier by automating, at least in part, my project&#39;s version numbers.
I thought, while only a partial help, that if I added a git post-commit
hook that bumped the patch number one, at the very least I could push
out patches without ever having to fuss with adjusting the version
number manually.</p>

<p><a href="http://book.git-scm.com/5_git_hooks.html">Git hooks</a>,
by the way, are a cinch to setup. Just edit the
<tt>.git/hooks/xxx</tt> script and turn on its user-executable
permission. As difficult as <tt>git</tt> itself can be to use at times,
this was about as easy as it could get --Developer&#39;s Hog Heaven.</p>

<p>Of course, I overlooked the simple fact that changing my project&#39;s
version file would itself need to be committed b/c it is also tracked
by the version control system, which would in turn invoke the hook,
modifying the version and requiring yet another commit, ad infinitum.
This wasn&#39;t going to work. Crap!</p>

<p>Yet, that little snafu really got the old brain juices flowing and
my fingers blogging. I want to make versioning my projects as simple as
Git&#39;s hooks are to create. Ultra-low maintenance and in need of barely
any consideration. Is it possible? I then thought about Ubuntu&#39;s
versioning policy. Now there&#39;s a low maintenance system! Just use the
release date. I like it. But... it doesn&#39;t tell you anything about the
release. Is it a major release? A minor release? Merely a bug fix?
Or a security fix? There&#39;s no way to tell. And consequently there is no
way to effect one&#39;s dependencies to use only a limited set versions per a
&quot;<a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/7">rational versioning policy</a>&quot;.</p>

<p>But wait a minute. What about these newfangled &quot;.a&quot; for alpha,
&quot;.b&quot; for beta, indicators that <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>
recently introduced? Aren&#39;t they a means communicating some fact about
the release? And yet are they really version numbers? They attempt
to emulate them by being single letters --sure we can enumerate by
letters just as well as numbers, but isn&#39;t that a shoe-horn --squeezing
information into a version &quot;look alike&quot; of sorts? And that being
the case, then hell with it, why not just do the whole version
scheme the same way.</p>

<p>To that end I propose we consider a new way to version, patterned
after date versions, a la Ubuntu, and augmented with informational
letter tags to tell us what kind of release with which we are dealing.
Let&#39;s consider some possible examples.</p>

<p>10.01.04      # major release
   10.01.05-m    # minor interface changes from previous release
   10.01.06-p    # patch release / bug fix to previous release
   10.02.11-s    # security fix to previous version
   10.04.06-a    # alpha release of next major version
   10.09.21-b    # beta release of next major version</p>

<p>That&#39;s a refreshingly simple scheme. All we would have to manually
specify at release time is the type via a single letter, the dating
is easily automated. (Note, I used a dash for no other reason than
it looked good to my eye. A dot could be used, or even nothing at
all. I really don&#39;t care what provides the delimitation myself.)</p>

<p>Granted, this version scheme doesn&#39;t tell us how many major releases or
minor releases or patch releases have been made since the project&#39;s inception.
But we don&#39;t really need to know that (and if we do we can just program our
package managers to run a summation). What we really need to know is simply
if there is a newer version than our current version, that it is a security fix,
or a minor update, or a major update, and so on, depending on our choice of
significance. Indeed I would even suggest that perhaps we add a some additional
types to help clarify further the type of release.</p>
